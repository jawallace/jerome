# jerome
A general probabilistic graphical models framework for Rust

In the same vein as [edward](edwardlib.org), jerome is named for [Jerome
Cornfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Cornfield), a pioneer
of Bayesian statistics that was the first to link a cause-effect relationship
between smoking and lung cancer and laid the groundwork for ["much of modern
epidemiology"](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2013/03/18/biography-of-jerome-cornfield.html).
